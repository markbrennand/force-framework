# Mocker

Documentation coming soon.

See the reference [Apex docs](SfApexDocs/mocker.html) for the API. It is suggested that you keep a page open
with the Apex docs loaded for your reference whilst reading this page.

If you wish to try the example unit test using Mocker in an org. Deploy the code in the
[example](https://github.com/markbrennand/force-frameworks/tree/gh-pages/example/mocker) directory to  your org if the
org has the Force Framework code deployed. If your org has the Force Framework package deployed, deploy the code in
the [example.pkg](https://github.com/markbrennand/force-frameworks/tree/gh-pages/example.pkg/mocker) directory.
